# Project: Advanced Ignore Channel Slash Command Bot

## Overview

- Develop a Discord bot with a slash command feature to ignore specific channels.
- Allow users to customize their experience by choosing which channels they want to ignore.
- Enhance user experience by reducing unwanted notifications from selected channels.

## Features

### Slash Command Integration

- Implement slash command functionality for ease of use.
- Allow users to interact with the bot through simple commands.

### Ignore Channel Functionality

- Enable users to select specific channels to ignore.
- Provide options to toggle ignore settings on and off for each channel.

### Customization Options

- Allow users to manage their ignored channels list.
- Enable users to add or remove channels from the ignore list as needed.

### Notification Settings

- Ensure that ignored channels do not trigger notifications for users.
- Improve user experience by reducing unnecessary distractions.

## Enhancements

### Multiple Server Support

- Enhance the bot to support multiple Discord servers.
- Allow users to configure ignore settings separately for each server.

### Advanced Ignore Options

- Implement advanced ignore options such as muting specific keywords.
- Enhance customization by adding more ignore criteria for users to choose from.

### User-Friendly Interface

- Create a user-friendly interface for managing ignore settings.
- Provide clear instructions and feedback to users when setting ignore preferences.

## Technical Details

### Programming Languages

- Node.js will be used to develop the Discord bot due to its compatibility with Discord's API and the availability of libraries and frameworks for building bots.

### APIs

- Discord API will be integrated to interact with Discord servers and handle slash commands.
- Node.js Discord.js library will be used to simplify interactions with the Discord API.

### Packages and Libraries

- Discord.js v13.1.0: To facilitate communication with the Discord API and handle interactions with Discord servers.
- Node.js v14.17.5: Latest stable version for building the bot's backend functionality.
- dotenv v10.0.0: To securely manage environment variables like bot tokens.
- axios v0.21.1: To handle HTTP requests for fetching data or interacting with external services.

### Rationale

- Node.js: Chosen for its asynchronous, event-driven architecture which is well-suited for handling multiple Discord interactions simultaneously.
- Discord API and Discord.js: Integrating the Discord API allows seamless communication with Discord servers and the implementation of slash commands.
- dotenv: Used to securely store sensitive information like bot tokens outside of the codebase to prevent accidental exposure.
- axios: Chosen for its simplicity and flexibility in making HTTP requests, which may be required for fetching data or integrating with external services.
